# Automatic Presentation Evaluation System

## Overview

**The Automatic Presentation Evaluation System is a web application designed to evaluate student presentations based on video and audio inputs. It provides features for user registration, login, student management, and detailed analysis of presentation videos. The system uses various deep learning models and APIs to process video and audio data, providing feedback on different aspects of the presentation such as emotions, speech rate, and sentiment.**
